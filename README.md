Portfolio


This portfolio is designed to give the user a way to display projects and current programming skills to future employers.

A effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning that they are live on the web) are typically much more successful in their career search. While having a nice portfolio is important having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. This portfolio also includes links to these projects as well as the users github, linkedIn, resume and other helpful contact information.
